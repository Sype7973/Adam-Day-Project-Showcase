# <Adam Day's Development Portfolio>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to create a webpage portfolio using the skills learn't in our Advanced HTML/CSS module
- I built this portfolio to serve as a canvas to test my HTML and CSS Skills and to also mimic functionality in my challenge acceptance criteria
- My portfolio webpage shows that I can utilise flex properties and media query to ensure my webpage design does not become distorted when shrinking for multiple sized viewports
- I learn't how to use Flex-wrap and flex direction to ensure my elements did not distort when being shrunk. I also learn't that container naming and sorting your containers appropriately is the golden rule for CSS design.
