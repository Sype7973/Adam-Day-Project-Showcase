      <h2 id="About-Me">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Adam,</p>
        <p>I am 29 Years old,</p>
        <p>I am a Gamer, average nerd and musician and enjoy everything Tech. My love for new technology comes from an admiration for Sci-fi, I read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" religiously as a teen, and had hopes of becoming a Sci-fi writer, however, writing about imaginary technology didn't scratch the itch I had for being a part of innovation.</p>
        <p>I currently work for an Energy efficient product manufacturer who creates a range of different innovative products (including an Energy Management App) aimed at the State legislated Energy Efficiency schemes. My role has me dipping my toe into exciting opportunities within a program development space. I hope to add meaningfully to the renewable energy space.</p>
        <p>My love for technology eventually landed me somewhere I enjoy being. However, you will read in my resume that I have worked in many different fields; which has served me in many ways. I cherish Family; I grew up with 3 siblings that are all intelligent in their own right and they have all taught me something that I still use to this day. </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio &#128513;.</p>
