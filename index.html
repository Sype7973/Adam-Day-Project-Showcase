      <p>Hi my name is Adam,</p>
      <p>I am a Gamer, average nerd and musician and enjoy everything Tech. My love for new technology comes from an admiration for Sci-fi, I read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" religiously as a kid. As a teen, and had hopes of becoming a Sci-fi writer, however, writing about imaginary technology didn't scratch the itch.</p>
      <p>I currently work for an Energy efficient product manufacturer who creates a range of different innovative products (including an Energy Management App) aimed at the State legislated Energy Efficiency schemes. My role has me dipping my toe into the innovative technology space and I am hoping to up-skill and be able to contribute meaningfully to this technological space.</p>
      <p>So my love for technology eventually landed me somewhere I enjoy being. However, you will read in my resume that i have worked in many different fields; which has served me in many ways</p>
      <p>A little about my me and my interests;-</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I Sing and record music, nothing ever took off! but I did get a play on Sydney's FBI Radio</li>
        <li>I love to Travel, I lived in Belarus for several months and have been to Japan multiple times.</li>
        <li>Smart Home Security systems</li>
        <li>Commercial LED Lights</li>
      </ul>
